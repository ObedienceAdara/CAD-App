#### **Pygame CAD**  

A simple CAD (Computer-Aided Design) application built with **Pygame**, designed to create and edit basic shapes such as lines, rectangles, circles, and polygons. This project demonstrates the integration of interactive tools, grid snapping, and undo/redo functionality, making it a great foundation for more advanced CAD systems.
